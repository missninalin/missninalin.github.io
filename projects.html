											<h3>SRI-RICE</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I designed and developed the SRI-RICE ONLINE website, moving the website platform from Dreamweaver to Drupal,
											allowing everyone to contribute information easily to the website. This transition would bring the website into
											a more modern look, attracting more viewers.

											<h3>ELEVATE</h3>

										<p>
											As part of the Hilton Hospitality Hackathon, I, with a team of 4 other "hackers", created a mobile application engraved
											into the Hilton Honors Program that would allow hotel stayers to experience a frictionless and

											<h3>Optimization of a Chem-e Car</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											As part of my first research, I, with a team of 4 chemical engineers, designed a shoe-sized car entirely powered by chemical processes.
											As part of the design team, I was in charge of designing the car to fit within competition regulations and as to not disturb the outcomes of
											each chemical process taking place.
