											<h3>SRI-RICE</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I designed and developed the SRI-RICE ONLINE website, moving the website platform from Dreamweaver to Drupal,
											allowing everyone to contribute information easily to the website. This transition would bring the website into
											a more modern look, attracting more viewers.

											<h3>ELEVATE</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											As part of the Hilton Hospitality Hackathon, I, with a team of 4 other "hackers", created a mobile application engraved
											into the Hilton Honors Program that would allow hotel stayers to experience a frictionless and
											personalized experience during their stay at the hotel and the local community.

											<h3>BizBuzz</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I, with a team of 5 other design students, came up with a website application that would allow business owners
											to communicate with other members of their business as well as communicate with local business owners and seek mentorship if needed.

											<h3>Richard Yang Photography</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I, with a team of 2 other coders, created a photography website for the client Richard Yang, who is starting out in photography and
											has a strong social media presence but no website. The website will be a platform for all his current
											and potential clients to view his work.

											<h3>BreakFree</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I, with a team of 5 other designers and coders, designed a website for the BreakFree club, a dance troupe on Cornell's campus. As the club did
											not have a website but did have strong social media presence, a website would congregate all their platforms together and give their users a unifying
											place to see all their performances.

											<h3>Curology</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											As Curology does not currently have a mobile application, but has a strong website, I designed and developed a mobile application that
											aligned with Curology's current design themes and addressed problems given by current Curology patients.
