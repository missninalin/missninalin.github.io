										<h2>About Me</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/aboutpic.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Hey there! I'm Nina Lin. I'm a New Jersey native, but I grew up in China so I often consider myself a mixture of east and
										west cultures. I currently study at Cornell University with a major in Information Science concentrated in User Experience.
										I plan to finish my undergraduate studies a year early before pursuing a Masters in Information Science. Besides from that,
										my goal in life to change the way people think and do things, making the impossible possible.

											<h3>My Background</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I grew up in a very tradition Chinese household, where my parents stressed education especically in the sciences
											and math. I grew up molding my life according to them, almost trying to fulfil their dreams and expectations. I've
											always had a passion for technology but felt it being suppressed by my parents' wish for me to become a doctor. It
											wasn't until my sophmore year in college that I wanted to chase my own dreams and do what I want to do in life. I
											greatly value family and appreciate everything my parents have done to raise me, and so everything I do, I
											do wholeheartedly as my goal is to make them proud.
										</p>

											<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											During my free time, I like to play around with my personal blog about beauty and fashion. I recently became
											interested in calligraphy and stationary, so some of my free time is spent on decorating my planner.I believe
											that staying organized and planning out my week and days are esstenial to living a less stressful life. Else, I am
											either trying out new recipes or spending time with family or friends.
